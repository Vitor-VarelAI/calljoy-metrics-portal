# ü§ñ CrewAI Integration ‚Äì CallScan

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for integrating CrewAI into CallScan to handle modular AI-based call analysis.

---

## üéØ Why CrewAI?

CrewAI allows us to create **autonomous agents**, each with a specific role in analyzing a call transcript. This architecture offers:

- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Better debugging and traceability
- Scalable logic (easy to add/remove agents)
- Dynamic model selection per agent
- Future-proofing for advanced analysis needs

## üß© Crew Structure

### üü¶ Inputs:
- `transcript`: Full call transcription (from Whisper)
- `custom_rules`: Script compliance rules provided per call center
- `priority`: Optional flag to select more advanced models if needed

## üß† Agents & Their Tasks

| Agent               | Task Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Compliance Reviewer** | Check whether the agent followed the client's compliance rules (`{custom_rules}`) |
| **Sentiment Analyzer**  | Analyze emotional tone and sentiment shifts throughout the conversation       |
| **Risk Detector**       | Identify critical, aggressive, or risky language usage                        |
| **Summary Generator**   | Create a short, natural-language summary of the full conversation             |
| **Improvement Advisor** | Suggest how the agent could improve, using outputs from the other agents       |

The `Improvement Advisor` agent takes inputs from the previous three agents to generate contextual, actionable suggestions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Flexibility

Each agent can run on a different model based on task complexity and business priority:

- GPT-3.5-turbo ‚Üí For lightweight tasks (compliance, sentiment, risk)
- GPT-4 or GPT-4-turbo ‚Üí For nuanced tasks (summary, suggestions)
- Open architecture supports plug-and-play LLM switching
